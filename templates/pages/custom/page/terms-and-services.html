Our goal is to deliver the Product(s) to you at the place of delivery requested by you in your order, provided that it is located within the United States, a US Territory or an APO/FPO address with a US zip code.  Please note that it may not be possible for us to deliver to some locations.  Should this be the case, we will inform you using your contact details and arrange for cancellation of the order or an alternative delivery address.
            </p>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                Delivery of any Product costing in excess of US$500 will require a signature acknowledging receipt to be delivered.  Such Products cannot be left at places of delivery stipulated in your order if you, or someone you have authorized to accept delivery, is not present to accept delivery.  Anyone at the delivery address who is 18 years of age or older will be deemed to be authorized to accept delivery on your behalf.  Once a Product is delivered to you, or if a signature is required, delivery is signed for by you or by someone at the delivery address, responsibility for your purchased Product(s) passes to you.
            </p>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                Our goal is to ship all purchased Products within two business days of the date on which you place your order or if you have chosen to have a Product monogramed or personalized within two business days of the date that the monograming or personalization of the Product is completed or such other timeframe as may be indicated on the Site.  If a Product in your order is backordered or being monogramed or personalized, your order may be processed with multiple shipments.  Although it is our intention to deliver Product(s) in accordance with any confirmed delivery date we have given to you for any order which we accept, we cannot guarantee any firm delivery dates.  We will endeavor to notify you if we anticipate that we will be unable to meet a confirmed delivery date, but in no event will we be responsible for any losses, liabilities, costs, damages, charges or expenses arising out of late delivery.     
            </p>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                We may offer you an option for two day delivery of your order.  However, if two day delivery is available through the Site, we only offer such delivery for orders placed (and for which we have received full payment) before 10:00 A.M. (EST).  Two day delivery may not be available for orders placed on, or that you want to be delivered on, Saturdays, Sundays or holidays.  Finally, the availability of two day delivery will always be subject to availability of stock, subject to a surcharge and be dependent on where the delivery location is.  Two day delivery does not apply to pre-order, backorder, or monogrammed/personalized items.    
            </p>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                Upon delivery of an order, you agree to inspect the Product(s) for the correct quantities and any obvious faults, defects or damage.
            </p>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                With respect to Products that cannot be delivered without a signature, if delivery is delayed through your unreasonable refusal to accept delivery, if you are not at the place of delivery stipulated in your order on the designated delivery date, if you refuse to sign for the delivery of the Product(s) on delivery or if you do not (within two weeks of our first attempt to deliver the Product(s) to you) accept delivery or collect the Product(s) from the carrier, then we may (without affecting any other right or remedy available to us) do either or both of the following: (x) charge you for our reasonable storage fee(s) and other costs reasonably incurred by us, including redelivery costs; and/or (y) no longer make the Product(s) available for delivery or collection and notify you that we are immediately cancelling your order, in which case we will refund to you or your credit/debit card company, as applicable, any money already paid to us, less our reasonable administration charges, including the amount charged for attempting to deliver and then returning the Product(s).

            </p>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                Returning Products is always at your risk.  If you return any Product for any reason, you must ensure that it is adequately packaged and insured.  We will not accept any responsibility for damage caused by inadequate packaging by you or if the Product is damaged or lost while being returned to us.
            </p>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">

If you have used the product, you will receive a credit to use at Pepper for 1-year from the date sent.  Refunds will be in the amount of the Product price plus taxes and will not include the original shipping cost.  We will process the refund due to you as soon as reasonably practicable after the Product(s) have been returned to us and, in any case, within 5 business days of our receipt of the returned Product(s).  Please note that refunds can take up to ten working days to appear in your account due to varying processing times between payment providers.
            </p>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                We will keep a record of your order and these Customer Terms & Conditions for a period of one year after we have accepted your order.  However, for your future reference we recommend that you print and keep a copy of these Customer Terms & Conditions, your order and the Confirmation of Order.
            </p>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                We offer a flexible return policy to make your on-line shopping experience even easier.  However, we do monitor the number of returns made and may refuse to accept orders at our discretion if Products are returned repeatedly.
            </p>
            <h3>FAULTY PRODUCTS</h3>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                Products are faulty if they are received damaged or where a manufacturing fault occurs within 40 days of order.  Products that are damaged as a result of normal wear and tear are not considered faulty.  If you return a damaged or faulty Product we will refund the initial shipping charges paid by you in addition to the amount of the Product price and taxes, if applicable.  To return a faulty or damaged Product, please follow the instructions above under “Returns.”
            </p>
            <h3>DISPUTES</h3>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                Any dispute or claim relating in any way to: (1.) your use of the Site, (2.) any Product or service sold or distributed by us or through our Site, or (3.) the order transaction will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.  The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
            </p>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                In arbitration, there is no judge or jury, but instead an arbitrator will hear both sides of the case, but court review is limited.  The arbitrator can award the same types of relief as a court, which includes injunctive relief, declaratory relief, or statutory damages.  The arbitrator must follow the terms of the Agreement as a court would.
            </p>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent CSC Services of Nevada, Inc., 2215-B Renaissance Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89119.  The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.  The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.  Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.  We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  Likewise, we will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  The arbitration can be conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
            </p>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.  If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.  We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
            </p>
            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law and the laws of the Nevada, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Nevada or any other jurisdiction).
            </p>
