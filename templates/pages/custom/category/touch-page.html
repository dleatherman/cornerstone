      content="Sometimes you have to forget the laundry, the to-do list, dishes and the whole routine, and just grab the one you love like you really, really mean it. Sure, a date out on the town can be fun, but staying indoors can be even better.
      
      Ok, the water’s warm so we’re diving in...
      
      Toys aren’t just for kids—just sayin’. You two can have a lot of fun (and make each other feel really great) with all kinds of good vibes. (Even the toys that don’t vibe can create quite the buzz.)
      
      Bottom line: we’re wired for touch. Sometimes creating that space for each other is all it takes to feel connected. And yeah, getting naked together helps. So, skip the lines, the reservations (in every sense of the word), get dressed up (or down) and create an experience for two that is all about connection." }}
