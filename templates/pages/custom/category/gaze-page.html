For some of us, a glance is all it takes, a wink or even a stare (did you know that two minutes of sustained eye contact can give you a serious case of deep love)?) to get us a little hot and bothered, and boy, are we fans of that.

      For the record, lingerie does not have to be an all-out war against comfort, but that doesn’t mean it can’t stir the senses. We love a silk robe or a soft, body-hugging chemise. But no matter what, we think making some time to take in the view is always a nice way to kick start some connection." }}
