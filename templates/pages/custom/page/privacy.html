                One way we collect data is from cookies and other data collection tools.  We, along with the service providers that help us provide the Services, use small alphanumeric files called cookies, which are small computer files sent to or accessed from your web browser or your computer's or tablet's hard drive that contain information about your computer, such as a user ID, user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using the Services.  Cookies are not themselves personally identifiable but may be linked to Personal Information that you provide to us through your interaction with the Services.  A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier.
            </p>

            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                Cookies help us improve the Services by tracking users' navigation habits and storing users' password, customizing users' experience with the Services; enabling us to analyze technical and navigational information about the Services; and helping to detect and prevent fraud.
            </p>

            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                We also use other cookies and other data collection tools (such as web beacons and server logs), which we collectively refer to as “data collection tools,” to help improve your experience with the Services.  For example, data collection tools help us remember users to personalize your return visits, make the Services more relevant to them, and to make checkout more efficient.

            </p>

            <p class="terms-paragraph">
                Web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings.  To find out more about cookies, including how to manage and delete cookies, visit <a href="www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.  Some web browsers (including some mobile web browsers) provide settings that allow a user to reject cookies or to alert a user when a cookie is placed on the user's computer, tablet or mobile device.  Most mobile devices also offer settings to reject mobile device identifiers.  Although users are not required to accept cookies or mobile device identifiers, blocking or rejecting them may prevent access to some features available through the Services.
