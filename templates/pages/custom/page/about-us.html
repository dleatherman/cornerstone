                <p>We met over twenty years ago and were married less than a year later. We’ve loved, worked and adventured, had four kids in five years, and weathered much of what many couples do—living to tell the wild tales.</p>

                <p>We thought people deserved a better experience. It also felt time to shift the conversation around sex. It’s all good right? And it wasn’t long after our night out that Pepper began to take shape. Because don’t we all want a better connection?</p>

            <p>Pepper isn’t simply a place to buy intimate products, it’s a destination to discover a fresh approach to playfulness and togetherness. Pepper is about reclaiming closeness and sustaining intimacy while creating permission for pleasure.</p>
            <p>We like to think of it as the sweeter side of spicy. We don’t think sexy has to be dirty, and we think keeping it fresh doesn’t have to be complicated.</p>

                <p>We're a wild bunch of humans who believe in connection. We don't have it all figured out, but we're on the job and journey together searching high and low to find the best out there for you. We hail from all corners of the country, and one of us even resides south of the border in Guatemala. We’re designers, writers, dreamers, and doers, and we’re all big fans of taste (as in eating delicious food) but we definitely wouldn’t kick any of the five senses out of bed. Speaking of bed, we’re glad you’re here getting to know Pepper, and we’re excited to connect more with you.</p>
