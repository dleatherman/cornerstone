      But listening is a big part of that equation.
      
      We like to draw a little outside of the lines (it’s kind of our thing), so we use what we hear as a way to tap into our
      turn-ons. Think: podcasts, playlists and all kinds of new ways to send messages from the heart.
      
      What we hear activates our senses in powerful and emotional ways.
      
      And we know that we can put that sensory experience to some really fun (sexy) use.." }}
