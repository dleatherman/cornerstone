      content="In the kitchen, on a table, in the bedroom, you can even do it outside—taste is an experience that can take you almost anywhere (oh, what did you think we were talking about?). Never to be underestimated, and we believe, always to be enjoyed, a lot happens (don’t even get us started) when we like what we taste.
      
      The pleasures of flavor and food have been bringing people together since the beginning of time, and while we love everything about that, what we want most is to bring you two even closer to each other.
      
      So, whether you do it at the dinner table, or in a park (eating, that is) mix in some delicious time together, and don’t forget to include some aphrodisiacs (apples, pistachios, and chocolate, just to name a few) to the menu.
      
      Now, we’re not suggesting that you get busy outdoors, but we certainly wouldn’t be mad at a little foreplay alfresco...and honestly, what better foreplay than feeding food to your love?" }}
