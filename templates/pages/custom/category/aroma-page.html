      content="Freshly baked cookies, pine trees in winter, a crackling fireplace, your love’s neck, their side of the bed or the scent
      of their skin—aroma inextricably ties our memory to our emotions, and we’re into it.
      
      When it comes to creating moods and experiences, there are so many ways to make memories (and love) fun. Some of our
      favorites include lighting the perfect candle, diffusers and drawing a bath enhanced with your favorite fragrance.
      
      Whether you like your partner au natural or with a splash of aftershave or perfume, we love the way a subtle smell can
      shift us in the most primal of ways." }}
